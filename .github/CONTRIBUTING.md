- Follow security best practices

### Configuration
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Provide sensible defaults
- Document all configuration options
- Validate configuration at startup

## Testing

### Required Tests
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Test OAuth2 flow integration
- Test Docker container functionality
- Test Tailscale connectivity (where possible)

### Testing Guidelines

### 📦 Backup Created

The old app has been backed up in multiple ways:
- 📁 **app_backup_20251003_113453/** - Full directory backup
- 🔀 **Git history** - Can restore with `git checkout main`
- 🌿 **Feature branch** - Working on `feature/route-manager`

---

## 🚀 Next Steps - Testing & Deployment

### 1. Build and Test Locally (Standalone Mode)

```powershell
# Navigate to app directory
cd app

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest -v

# Start the app (standalone mode for development)
python app.py

# Access at: http://localhost:8000
# Note: No OAuth in standalone mode - perfect for development
```

### 2. Build Docker Image

```powershell
# Return to project root
cd ..

# Build the Docker image
docker-compose build app

# Check for any build errors
```

### 3. Test Docker Setup

```powershell
# Start only the app service (without OAuth2 proxy)
docker-compose up app

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# In another terminal, test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 4. Full Production Test

```powershell
# Start all services (app + oauth2-proxy)
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are running
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Test the OAuth flow
# Visit: http://localhost:4180 (or your Funnel URL)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Container won't start
```powershell
# Check logs
docker-compose logs app

# Rebuild from scratch
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

### Routes not persisting
```powershell
# Check if routes.json exists
ls routes.json

# Check Docker volume
docker-compose exec app ls -la /app/routes.json

# If missing, create empty file
echo "{}" > routes.json
```

### Can't access admin page
- Ensure email is in emails.txt
- Check OAuth2 proxy is running
- Verify X-Forwarded-Email header is set
- Check browser console for errors

### Proxy not working
- Test route connectivity from admin page
- Check target service is running
- Verify IP is reachable from container
- Check firewall rules
